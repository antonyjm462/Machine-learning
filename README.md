# Machine-learning
“Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.” – Stanford
## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a process by which a computer program learns to do a particular action without being explicitly programmed.

A computer program is said to learn from Experience E, with respect to  some task T and some performance level P,the if performance P on the task T increases with experience E.

### Types of Machine learning algorithms
- *Supervised Learning*
- *Unsupervised learning*
- *Semisupervised learning*

## Supervised learning
In supervised learning,
we have input variable X and output variable Y , We use a algorithm to learn mapping input X to output Y such that f(X)=Y
Our goal is to make the alogorithm so accurate that if we have a new input we colud be able predict the output.
Its called Supervised learning because, here we provide the algorithm with right answers.Here DATA SET will act as a teacher to algorithm.As it makes ittrative predictions about trainig data the DATA SET will correct the algorithm.When it will reach a acceptable amount of accuracy it stops.

### Types of Supervised learning
- *Regression : if algorithm predict continous valued output*
- *classificaton: if algorithm predict discrete valued output*

**Eg:**
- **REGRESSION**:house price prediction
- **CLASSIFICATON**:pridict wheather a pacient has beging or malignant tumor
