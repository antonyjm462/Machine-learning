# Machine-learning
“Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.” – Stanford
## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a process by which a computer program learns to do a particular action without being explicitly programmed.

A computer program is said to learn from Experience E, with respect to  some task T and some performance level P,the if performance P on the task T increases with experience E.

### Types of Machine learning algorithms
- *Supervised Learning*
- *Unsupervised learning*
- *Semisupervised learning*

## Supervised learning
In supervised learning,
we have input variable X and output variable Y , We use a algorithm to learn mapping input X to output Y such that f(X)=Y
.Our goal is to make the alogorithm so accurate that if we have a new input we colud be able predict the output.
Its called Supervised learning because, here we provide the algorithm with right answers.Here DATA SET will act as a teacher to algorithm.As it makes ittrative predictions about trainig data the DATA SET will correct the algorithm.When it will reach a acceptable amount of accuracy it stops.

### Types of Supervised learning
- *Regression : if algorithm predict continous valued output*
- *classificaton: if algorithm predict discrete valued output*

**Eg:**
- **REGRESSION**:house price prediction
- **CLASSIFICATON**:pridict wheather a pacient has beging or malignant tumor

## Unsupervised learning
In unsupervised learning,you have input x but don't have a output. The Aim of the Unsupervised learning is to recogonise the Structure or Distribution in Data to Know more about the data, Here we have no teacher or right answers.Algorithms are on theirown to represent intresting Structure in data

### Types of Unsupervised learning
- *Clustering : if algorithm predict inherent groupings in data*
- *Association : if algorithm predict rules that describe large portions of your data*

**Eg:**
- **CLUSTERING**: grouping a set of news to spefic topics
- **ASSOCIATION**: people that buy X also tend to buy Y

## Semisupervised learning
In Semisupervised learning, There are large amount of input data X and only small amount is labeled Y output
this learning is between supervised and unsupervised learning.
**Eg:**
- In Photo archive only small percent are labelled and the rest are unlabelled.

# SUMMARY
- **SUPERVISED**: the learning in which data set are labelled and algorithm predicts the output from input.
- **UNSUPERVISED**: the learning in which data sets are not labelled and algorithm predicts the inherent Structure in data
- **SEMI SUPERVISED**: the learning in which large amount of data are unlabelled and some are labelled , the algorithm predicts the output fron input.
